# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard

In this Project I have created the  Coffee Sales Dashboard with various components like pivot charts(Line chart to show Total sales over time,Bar charts for Top 5 Customers,Total sales by country)Timelines,Slicers with all filters interconnected.

First of all i have cleaned the data in the 3 datasets then modeled them and brought the necessary data in one sheet using  VLookup,Index,Match,IF functions by creating new columns and prepared the data for analysis.

Analyzed the data by creating pivot tables and pivort charts to find the KPI.

Created the timeline and slicers using pivot tables.

Created the Dashborad using pivot charts,timelines and slicers along with interconnected filters.
